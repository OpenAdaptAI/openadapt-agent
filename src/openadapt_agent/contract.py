"""The partner result contract: one shape, four outcomes, plain words.

Every agent-facing result in this package is derived here: ``run_workflow``,
``get_run``, the deprecated ``run_<id>`` tools, ``get_run_report``, and the
Agent Skill text. A calling agent decides one thing from a result: move on,
wait for a person, have a person check the record, or fix something and try
again. The four outcomes map one-to-one onto those decisions.

Safety rules this module enforces by construction:

- The plain result is a pure function of Flow's ``transaction_outcome``, the
  process facts (did Flow start, did it exit cleanly, did it time out), the
  state of any durable pause, and a consistency check of the persisted report.
  The coarse ``HALTED`` label alone never selects a result.
- Only ``done`` says the change was saved, and only a consistent ``VERIFIED``
  report can produce it. How strong the proof is (``local``, ``sealed``, or
  ``simulated`` in the sandbox) is a separate field. A verified write is never
  reported as an error.
- ``record_changed: "no"`` and ``safe_to_retry: true`` appear only for results
  whose evidence proves nothing was written. Uncertain delivery (including a
  timeout after Flow started) is ``not_sure_if_saved`` with
  ``safe_to_retry: false``.
- A run with an open durable pause is ``needs_review``: a person holds the
  decision, so the caller must not start the same work again.
- Every sentence is fixed copy keyed by a closed reason code. No observed screen
  text, recorded value, input value, or local path can reach a result.
